## Description <a name="description"></a>
This application is designed to make managing a roster of employees easy by gathering information via inquirer in node.js and using the data to update an employee database housed in MySQL.  There are three tables of information: employees, roles, and departments, each connecting to the other at certain data points.  When you view all employees, you will see each piece of relevant data, even though they are not all on the Employee table.  Through the interface the user can update employees' roles, delete employees, add and view employees, roles, and departments.
